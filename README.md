# Parking Lot Management  

## About 

Parking lot manager (PLM) is a web application that oversees parking spaces, allowing existing users to create parking sessions, view analytics and update their vehicle and personal information. Our application is an inventory tracker that features a parking log, a record of both vacant and occupied parking spaces, and updates instantaneously to ensure individuals are able to gain insight of the usage of the parking spots. Moreover, our application contains a history page, in which users are able to view parking history, ticket history and summary, and have the ability to select the information they wish to view.
